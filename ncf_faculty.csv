As a New College professor, Professor Baram has moved his principle area of research from the eastern Mediterranean to the west coast of Florida. In the eastern Mediterranean he has studied the material culture, cultural landscapes, Western travel accounts, and social identities of the Ottoman Empire. Current research on the Middle East examines the intersection of archaeology and heritage tourism.</p> <p>As a faculty member at New College, Professor Baram has created local programs in archaeology and heritage studies. For example, the public anthropology program Looking for Angola employs the dual lens of archaeology and ethnography to reveal a `history from below’ for an early nineteenth century maroon community in the context of the anthropological critiques of racism and the histories of southwestern Florida. As the founding director of the New College Public Archaeology Lab, Professor Baram has trained students in historic preservation, public outreach, and anthropological studies of the recent past.</p> <p>Professor Baram has edited and contributed to A Historical Archaeology of the Ottoman Empire: Breaking New Ground (2000), Marketing Heritage: Archaeology and the Consumption of the Past (2004), and Between Art and Artifact: Approaches to Visual Representation in Historical Archaeology (2007) as well as many journal articles and research reports on historical archaeology, heritage, and the politics of the past.</p> <p><strong>Recent Courses</strong><br /> Historical Archaeology<br /> Race and Ethnicity in Global Perspective</p> <p><strong>Selected </strong><strong>Publications<br /> </strong>2012 <em>Cosmopolitanism and Ethnogenesis, Colonialism and Resistance: Themes in the Historical Archaeology of Florida</em>, edited by Uzi Baram and Dan Hughes.

His current research focuses on the shifting set of formal, conceptual, and perceptual relationships that develop between poetry and the novel between approximately 1750 and 1900. The book project that is emerging from this research makes two broad arguments. First, Romantic-era narrative poetry and the novel participated in a shared history of narrative form and innovation. This shared context, paired with the increasingly sophisticated demands of the publishing industry, allowed narrative poetry to exercise considerable influence on developments of the novel during this time. In particular, free indirect discourse and impersonal narration, often understood to be among the novel’s signature contributions to literary history, are enabled by formal developments that first appear in narrative poetry. Second, since its origin, “the novel” has been bound into a conceptual binary with “poetry.” This binary functions at the level of the experience of reading and in the genre-concepts that readers use to categorize those experiences. Appearing since the earliest discussions of the novel itself, the novel-poetry binary has become codified in our conceptual schema as a result of constant usage over the last several hundred years.</p> <p><strong>Current Courses</strong><br /> Poetry of Love and Heartbreak<br /> Bestselling Poetry in the 19th Century</p> <p><strong>Selected Publications</strong><br /> “Narrator’s Care: Intrusive Narration as Formal Caregiving,” in The Workshop 4 (2016): 15-25</p> <p>Proceedings from Indiana University, Center for Eighteenth Century Studies, Workshop on the Subject of “Who Cares?”</p> <p>“Teaching the Poetry of Walter Scott,” online contribution to the Teaching Romanticism series at Romantic Textualities: Literature and Print Culture, 1780-1840 (2014).</p> <p>“The Form of Media History: Narrator-Space and The Lay of the Last Minstrel,” Studies in English Literature 1500-1900 54.3 (Summer 2014): 697-716.</p> <p>“Form and Generic Interrelation in the Romantic Period: Walter Scott’s Poetic Influence on Jane Austen,” Narrative 22.1 (January 2014): 45-67.</p> ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ncf.edu/directory/listing/nick-bujak/,faculty,,English,english,https://www.ncf.edu/directory/listing/nick-bujak/,null

She is interested in how plant cells perceive extracellular signals and transduce these signals into intracellular changes in biochemistry, gene expression, and cytoskeletal architecture.</p> <p>Her current research focuses on early endosperm development in maize. Funding for the research is provided in part by a nearly $400,000 grant she received from the National Science Foundation as part of a national research team. In addition, Dr. Clore is also studying maize pulvini, specialized organs found along the maize plant stem that sense when the plant has been tipped and reorient growth, as well as how carpel epidermal cells redifferentiate during carpel fusion in Madagascar periwinkle.</p> <p>Besides her recent National Science Foundation grant, Dr. Clore and two other New College professors in the natural sciences received a NSF grant in 2006 to further their research into animal and plant development and gene expression. Through that grant, New College became one of only a small number of undergraduate institutions in the U.S. to have a real-time PCR instrument to measure DNA and RNA levels in tissue samples taken from organisms.</p> <p>Professor Clore teaches Cellular Biology (lecture and laboratory), Topics in Plant Development, Plant Physiology, Developmental Biology, Topics in Cell Signaling and General Biology: from Molecules to Organism.</p> <p><strong>Recent Courses</strong><br /> Cellular Biology<br /> Cell Biology Lab<br /> Plant Phsyiology<br /> Plant Physiology Lab</p> <p><strong>Honors and Awards</strong><br /> National Science Foundation Grant (2006)<br /> <strong><br /> Selected Publications</strong></p> <p>Dashek, W and Clore, A.M.

Her commitment to gender studies is reflected in a number of courses ranging from “Film Noir and Masculinity” to “Women Artists through the Ages;” and gender theory courses such as “Madness and Modernism” and “Images of Women in the Twentieth Century.”</p> <p>She has long been interested in the transformation and deconstruction of identity in Twentieth-Century Art. She finds self-portraits of artists of particular interest and has written on Mallarmé’s identification with a Faun, Picasso with the Minotaur, and Max Ernst with Lop Lop, the bird superior.  She has written on artists, who use cross-dressing to undermine gender constructions: Claude Cahun and Marcel Duchamp, or who present themselves as absent in their self portraits (Jim Dine’s empty bathrobe), and others who accept double or even multiple identities (Cindy Sherman) in their creations of alter-ego. The deconstruction of identity obviously has important implications for the problem of who we are in modern culture.

Her scholarship, broadly speaking, focuses on the literary and cultural repercussions in America of philosophical skepticism, idealism, and empiricism. Her book-in-progress, Conjecture Flourishing: Emily Dickinson’s Poetics and Manuscripts, argues that Dickinson’s apparent postmodernity and process-oriented manuscript choices are the result of her philosophical engagement with Hume’s devastating critique of Western metaphysics. Hume’s ideas are legible in the subsequent Scottish Common Sense reaction, in both philosophy and rhetoric, that Dickinson was taught, especially in Common Sense thinking about language, mind, and experience. Hubbard’s work has won the support of an NEH Summer Stipend (2005) and an NEH Research Fellowship (2006-2007). Her creative writing tends toward experimental inquiry using a variety of constraints or ground conditions, including parameters such as visual art and sound.

I am an Assistant Professor of Religion at New College of Florida, where I teach courses on Buddhism, Tibetan Buddhism, Buddhist Contemplative Systems, Hinduism, and Asian Religions in general. I am also interested in the intersection of religion and popular culture and write about it in a <a href=""https://religionandpopcultureblog.wordpress.com/"" target=""_blank"" data-saferedirecturl=""https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&q=https://religionandpopcultureblog.wordpress.com/&source=gmail&ust=1481659183502000&usg=AFQjCNHD4SehVGkPENAnPSQTA-hXyxgVAw"">blog</a>.</p> <div> I am currently working on a book project under the title A Light in the Darkness: Meditation and the Construction of Tibetan Buddhism, that explores the diversity of Buddhist contemplative practices popular across Asia around the turn of the first millennia (10th century) through the life and works of the Tibetan scholar Nupchen Sangyé Yeshé. His biography presents a complex and fascinating figure (pious, but also willing to resort to violence if necessary in order to protect Buddhism) who travelled tirelessly across the continent (Nepal, India, Gilgit) in search of Buddhist teachings.</div> <p>I am also working on a secondary research project under the title From Suffering to Happiness: Buddhism and its transformations in the West that explores the evolution on the perception and interpretation of Buddhism in the West (from suffering to happiness) beginning with German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer’s pessimistic presentation of the tradition in his 1818 work The World as Will and Representation, to the radically different presentation of the tradition in the last two decades in works such as Dalai Lama’s 1998 book The Art of Happiness and Thich Nhat Hanh’s 2009 Happiness: Essential Mindfulness Practices. Has Buddhism changed? Or is the West reinterpreting the Buddhist tradition to suit a different existential outlook on human nature? What is the role of some Buddhist figures in this transformation? Are figures like the Dalai Lama and Thich Nhat Hanh simply applying the old Buddhist practice of Skillful Means (Skt. up_ya) in their explanation of Buddhism to a Western audience, or are they dramatically changing the nature of the Buddhist doctrine as its being introduced in the West? My project explores these questions while questioning our definitions a Buddhism in particular, and religion in general.</p> <p>I completed my undergraduate studies at the University Pompey Fabra (UPF) in Barcelona, Spain and my graduate work at the University of Virginia. I also have extensive experience studying in Asia. Between 1999 and 2001, I studied Tibetan and Chinese as well as Buddhism and Tibetan literature at Northwest Minorities University in Lanzhou (Gansu Province), and at Tibet University, in Lhasa (Tibetan Autonomous Region). In 2013 I studied and did field research for my dissertation at Minzu University of China. Between 2003 and 2009 I also worked as director and lecturer of the SIT Study Abroad Tibetan and Himalayan Studies Program, based in Kathmandu, Nepal, which allowed me to experience and study the rich diversity of the religious traditions across the Himalayas, as I lived, worked, and traveled in Northern India (Dharamsala), Nepal, Bhutan, and Tibet itself.</p> <p><strong>RECENT COURSES</strong><br /> Introduction to Buddhism<br /> Introduction to Hinduism</p> <p>Read more here: <a href=""https://manuclasses.wordpress.com"">https://manuclasses.wordpress.com</a></p> ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.ncf.edu/directory/listing/manuel-lopez-zafra/,faculty,,Humanities,humanities,https://www.ncf.edu/directory/unit/humanities/,null

She has also completed two postdoctoral appointments; one evaluating the population genetics of Gulf of Mexico sturgeon and the other with the U.S. EPA on predicting the risk of near shore marine species to extinction due to climate change.</p> <p>Her primary research interests are on animal populations that are small or declining and she focuses on butterflies, many of which are state or federally-endangered. Dr. Saarinen uses a combination of field and laboratory based methods to evaluate the current status of small populations and couples this with museum-based research to evaluate historical population trends. In her molecular lab, she uses techniques to evaluate small tissue samples of butterflies to determine remaining levels of genetic diversity, gene flow, and inbreeding. Genomic scans from next-generation sequencing has recently been useful at identifying novel molecular markers for her work. She has received multiple grants from the United States Fish & Wildlife Service and other state and federal agencies to support this research.

Broadly speaking, her research so far has focused on investigating traditional China’s traumatic encounters with the modern world around late nineteenth to early twentieth century, analyzing the subsequent social and cultural reconfigurations, ruptures, and continuities that a variety of Chinese individuals and groups experienced during this process. Specifically, her current research interests include the history of late Qing and Republican China, women and gender, history of religion and “superstition,” history of charity and philanthropy, and environmental disasters responses.</p> <p>She is currently working on a book manuscript tentatively titled <em>At Home in the World: Women and Charity in China, 1870s-1930s</em>. It examines how some married, nonprofessional Chinese women without modern educations — women assumed to be the opposite of the progressive, independent “New Woman” — moved out of domestic seclusion and became active and effective actors through charitable and religious activities in the newly opened public world during a crucial transitional period of Chinese history. It highlights the significance of religious and charitable activities as forms of social, civic and political engagement, socializing, and networking for Chinese women. It demonstrates how the legacy of their pasts facilitated women’s adaptation to the new public world in significant ways and therefore emphasizes how reconfigured traditions became essential components of modernity in the development of modern Chinese gender roles.</p> <h4>Recent Courses</h4> <p>Chinese History to 1800<br /> Chinese History Since 1800<br /> East Asian Civilization<br /> The World Since 1870<br /> Women and Gender in China<br /> Republican China (1912-49)<br /> Historical Methods</p> <h4>Selected Honors and Awards</h4> <p>Henry Luce Foundation/ACLS (American Council of Learned Societies) Program in China Studies Postdoctoral Fellowship, 2015-16</p> <h4>Selected Publications</h4> <p><strong>Books</strong><br /> <em>At Home in the World: Women and Charity in China, 1870s-1930s</em> (Under review by Columbia University Press)</p> <p><span style=""line-height: 1.3em;""><strong>Articles</strong><br /> </span> “Stepping into the Public World: Cases of Guixiu Philanthropic Activities in Late Qing China,” <em>Frontiers of History in China,</em> June 2014.</p> <p>“Wei Cheng: From an Elite Novel to a Popular Metaphor.” In China in 2008: <em>A Year of Great Significance,</em> edited by Kate Merkel-Hess, Kenneth Pomeranz and Jeffrey N.

Dr Yildirim is interested in development of quantitative mathematical models that are comparable with experimental data to address such questions.</p> <p>Before coming to New College, Professor Yildirim held postdoctoral positions at UNC-Chapel Hill and McGill University.</p> <p><strong>Recent Courses</strong><br /> Linear Algebra<br /> Mathematical Modeling I<br /> Differential Equations<br /> Advanced Linear Algebra</p> <p><strong>Selected Publications<br /> Yildirim N.</strong>, Violin JD., DiPilato LM., Elston TC., Zhang J. and Lefkowitz RJ.

This is a field as old as Western culture itself, but I spend most of my time on American poetry written during the period from the end of the nineteenth-century to the present day. As I read, study, and teach poetry, I am constantly interested in the unexpectedly vexing question of what, exactly, it is – I mean, if you were to stumble upon a sheet of paper with some words on it, how would you tell whether or not it is a poem? One test: if you can identify with the workings of the words in a way very similar to how you might identify with the development of a song, then it’s pretty likely that those marks on the page are the words of a poem. In fact, I often tell my students that reading a poem is more like listening to music than it is like reading a novel. Just what I mean by that is a touchstone of nearly everything I teach and write.</p> <p>My current research explores the relationship between innovative literary practice and music in post-World War II American poetry. Most of this work finds its way into my book project, <em>Orphic Bend: Music and Innovative Writing</em>, which treats a wide range of writers, including Charles Bernstein, Jayne Cortez, Robert Creeley, Nathaniel Mackey, and John Taggart. Exploring the relationship between poetry and music in avant-garde opera, jazz aesthetics, performance poetry, postmodern pastoralism, and the elegy, the book identifies an exciting strain in contemporary innovative writing that participates in ancient debates over what music is, where it comes from, and what it does.</p> <p><strong>Thesis Sponsorship</strong><br /> My thesis students generally focus on American poetry since 1900. I have overseen projects on topics including contemporary prose poetry, the political and philosophical underpinnings of experimental writing, poetry as performance, jazz poetry, the politics of race in experimental black poetry and music, and others; and, I have worked closely with faculty in other fields to co-sponsor projects exploring poetry and disability studies, musical aesthetics in the work of James Joyce, contemporary Cuban-American poetry, and others. Outside of English, I have also sponsored thesis projects in the Humanities on radio documentary, the publishing history of the zine, and digital poetics.</p> <p><strong>Recent Courses</strong><br /> Acoustic Machine: Modern Poetry and Music<br /> The Black Mountain School / The New York School<br /> Lines of Sight: the Ekphrastic Tradition from Homer to Today<br /> The Poetry and Poetics of Place<br /> Reading Poetry</p> <p><strong>Selected Publications</strong><br /> “Ezra Pound and Charles Bernstein: Opera, Poetics, and the Fate of Humanism.” Forthcoming in <em>Texas Studies in Language and Literature.</em></p> <p>“The ‘Umbilicate Ear’: Audition in Ed Roberson’s<em> Lucid Interval as Integral Music</em>.” Callaloo.
