As a New College professor, Professor Baram has moved his principle area of research from the eastern Mediterranean to the west coast of Florida. In the eastern Mediterranean he has studied the material culture, cultural landscapes, Western travel accounts, and social identities of the Ottoman Empire. Current research on the Middle East examines the intersection of archaeology and heritage tourism.<\/p>\n<p>As a faculty member at New College, Professor Baram has created local programs in archaeology and heritage studies. For example, the public anthropology program Looking for Angola employs the dual lens of archaeology and ethnography to reveal a `history from below&#8217; for an early nineteenth century maroon community in the context of the anthropological critiques of racism and the histories of southwestern Florida. As the founding director of the New College Public Archaeology Lab, Professor Baram has trained students in historic preservation, public outreach, and anthropological studies of the recent past.<\/p>\n<p>Professor Baram has edited and contributed to A Historical Archaeology of the Ottoman Empire: Breaking New Ground (2000), Marketing Heritage: Archaeology and the Consumption of the Past (2004), and Between Art and Artifact: Approaches to Visual Representation in Historical Archaeology (2007) as well as many journal articles and research reports on historical archaeology, heritage, and the politics of the past.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Recent Courses<\/strong><br \/>\nHistorical Archaeology<br \/>\nRace and Ethnicity in Global Perspective<\/p>\n<p><strong>Selected\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Publications<br \/>\n<\/strong>2012\u00a0<em>Cosmopolitanism and Ethnogenesis, Colonialism and Resistance: Themes in the Historical Archaeology of Florida<\/em>, edited by Uzi Baram and Dan Hughes.

Her first book,\u00a0<em>Urban Legends: Italian Civic Identity &amp; the Classical Past, 1250\u20131350<\/em>\u00a0(2011) explores the use of the classical Roman past as political propaganda in the medieval Italian city-states; she is presently at work on a second book on the changing role of the classical SPQR abbreviation in the politics, ideology, and iconography of medieval and Renaissance Italy. Her other academic interests include book history (palaeography, codicology, illumination, and the history of libraries), Italian humanism, the history and historiography of the Renaissance, urban history, and the plague; course offerings encompass these subjects as well as general surveys of the medieval, Renaissance, and early modern periods. She has received numerous professional honors, including most recently (2008\u20139) a Mellon Foundation Post-Doctoral Rome Prize at the American Academy in Rome, Italy.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Recent Courses<\/strong><br \/>\nNorman Conquests of the Medieval World<br \/>\nRenaissance &amp; Reformation Europe<br \/>\nThe Black Death<br \/>\nHistorical Methods<\/p>\n<p><strong>Honors and Awards<\/strong><br \/>\nAndrew W.

His current research focuses on the shifting set of formal, conceptual, and perceptual relationships that develop between poetry and the novel between approximately 1750 and 1900. The book project that is emerging from this research makes two broad arguments. First, Romantic-era narrative poetry and the novel participated in a shared history of narrative form and innovation. This shared context, paired with the increasingly sophisticated demands of the publishing industry, allowed narrative poetry to exercise considerable influence on developments of the novel during this time. In particular, free indirect discourse and impersonal narration, often understood to be among the novel\u2019s signature contributions to literary history, are enabled by formal developments that first appear in narrative poetry. Second, since its origin, \u201cthe novel\u201d has been bound into a conceptual binary with \u201cpoetry.\u201d This binary functions at the level of the experience of reading and in the genre-concepts that readers use to categorize those experiences. Appearing since the earliest discussions of the novel itself, the novel-poetry binary has become codified in our conceptual schema as a result of constant usage over the last several hundred years.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Current Courses<\/strong><br \/>\nPoetry of Love and Heartbreak<br \/>\nBestselling Poetry in the 19th Century<\/p>\n<p><strong>Selected Publications<\/strong><br \/>\n\u201cNarrator\u2019s Care: Intrusive Narration as Formal Caregiving,\u201d in The Workshop 4 (2016): 15-25<\/p>\n<p>Proceedings from Indiana University, Center for Eighteenth Century Studies, Workshop on the Subject of \u201cWho Cares?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTeaching the Poetry of Walter Scott,\u201d online contribution to the Teaching Romanticism series at Romantic Textualities: Literature and Print Culture, 1780-1840 (2014).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe Form of Media History: Narrator-Space and The Lay of the Last Minstrel,\u201d Studies in English Literature 1500-1900 54.3 (Summer 2014): 697-716.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cForm and Generic Interrelation in the Romantic Period: Walter Scott\u2019s Poetic Influence on Jane Austen,\u201d Narrative 22.1 (January 2014): 45-67.<\/p>\n","link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/listing\/nick-bujak\/","employee_type":["faculty"],"department":[{"name":"English","slug":"english","link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/listing\/nick-bujak\/"},{"name":"Humanities","slug":"humanities","link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/unit\/humanities\/"}],"exclude":null},{"slug":"dana-bulger","first_name":"Dana","last_name":"Bulger","pref_name":null,"position":"Coordinator of Administrative Services","phone_number":"9414874464","email_address":"dbulger@ncf.edu","office_location":"PHS","mail_location":"PHS 104","user_image":"https:\/\/newcollege.smugmug.com\/photos\/i-dMvGXhg\/0\/X2\/i-dMvGXhg-X2.jpg","bio_content":"","link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/listing\/dana-bulger\/","employee_type":["staff"],"department":[{"name":"Physical Plant","slug":"physical-plant","link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/unit\/physical-plant\/"}],"exclude":null},{"slug":"samantha-burns","first_name":"Samantha","last_name":"Burns","pref_name":"","position":"Visiting Assistant Professsor of Art","phone_number":"9414874287","email_address":"sburns@ncf.edu","office_location":"CFA 111","mail_location":"ACE 116","user_image":"https:\/\/newcollege.smugmug.com\/photos\/i-L5cn2x4\/0\/O\/i-L5cn2x4.jpg","bio_content":"<p><big>Visiting Artist<\/big><\/p>\n<p>MFA, Florida State University<br \/>\nBFA, University of Tampa<\/p>\n<p>Samantha Burns is an interdisciplinary artist whose works have been exhibited in national\u00a0and international venues.

What I enjoy most about New College is working with our Student Admissions Representatives; they are all truly amazing and intelligent individuals. When I\u2019m not working I enjoy going to the beach, shopping at the farmers market on Saturdays and taking in the sunsets at the bay.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hometown<\/strong><br \/>\nSt. Louis, MO<\/p>\n","Territory_States":"","territory_fl_counties":"","link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/listing\/carley-davis\/","employee_type":["admissions-counselor","staff"],"department":[{"name":"Admissions","slug":"admissions","link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/unit\/admissions\/"}],"exclude":null},{"slug":"alan-dawson","first_name":"Alan","last_name":"Dawson","pref_name":null,"position":"Associate Director of Physical Plant","phone_number":"9414874695","email_address":"adawson@ncf.edu","office_location":"PHS","mail_location":"PHS 104","user_image":"https:\/\/newcollege.smugmug.com\/photos\/i-dMvGXhg\/0\/X2\/i-dMvGXhg-X2.jpg","bio_content":"","link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/listing\/alan-dawson\/","employee_type":["staff"],"department":[{"name":"Physical Plant","slug":"physical-plant","link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/unit\/physical-plant\/"}],"exclude":null},{"slug":"erin-dean","first_name":"Erin","last_name":"Dean","pref_name":null,"position":"Associate Professor of Anthropology","phone_number":"9414874269","email_address":"edean@ncf.edu","office_location":"CHL 235","mail_location":"SSC 102","user_image":"https:\/\/newcollege.smugmug.com\/photos\/i-FGTMtBN\/0\/X2\/i-FGTMtBN-X2.jpg","bio_content":"<p><big>Associate Professor of Anthropology<\/big><\/p>\n<p>Ph.D., University of Arizona<br \/>\nM.A., University of Arizona<br \/>\nB.A., University of Kansas<\/p>\n<p>Professor Dean is an environmental anthropologist whose research focuses on conservation and development in Tanzania and Zanzibar. She situates her anthropological work within the interdisciplinary subfield of political ecology, and she is particularly interested in how control of land and resources is negotiated and ordered based on gender, age, ethnicity, class, political affiliation, and institutional status. Her ongoing work considers a variety of topics of both emergent and persistent concern to community members, including forest and marine conservation, \u201cparticipatory\u201d resource management, knowledge production, gendered identity, alternative energy development, land rights, and political authority. Her recent publications include articles in the journals Human Organization and the Journal of Contemporary African Studies.<\/p>\n<p>At New College, Professor Dean also coordinates the Sarasota Water Oral History Project, This collaboration with Sarasota County and the Water Atlas explores how water resources are understood and remembered by local residents.

Her scholarship, broadly speaking, focuses on the literary and cultural repercussions in America of philosophical skepticism, idealism, and empiricism. Her book-in-progress, Conjecture Flourishing: Emily Dickinson\u2019s Poetics and Manuscripts, argues that Dickinson\u2019s apparent postmodernity and process-oriented manuscript choices are the result of her philosophical engagement with Hume\u2019s devastating critique of Western metaphysics. Hume\u2019s ideas are legible in the subsequent Scottish Common Sense reaction, in both philosophy and rhetoric, that Dickinson was taught, especially in Common Sense thinking about language, mind, and experience. Hubbard\u2019s work has won the support of an NEH Summer Stipend (2005) and an NEH Research Fellowship (2006-2007). Her creative writing tends toward experimental inquiry using a variety of constraints or ground conditions, including parameters such as visual art and sound. Publications include a chapbook, Gilbi Winco Swags (Cannibal, 2008), We Have With Us Your Sky (Subito, 2012), and selected pages from a work in progress, Auto-Suggestion for Mothers.<\/p>\n<p>Connect to her work online at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.melaniehubbard.net\/\" target=\"_blank\">melaniehubbard.net.<\/a><\/p>\n","link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/listing\/melanie-hubbard\/","employee_type":["faculty"],"department":[{"name":"Humanities","slug":"humanities","link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/unit\/humanities\/"}],"exclude":null},{"slug":"madeline-huffstickler","first_name":"Madeline","last_name":"Huffstickler","pref_name":"","position":"Psychology Laboratory Technician","phone_number":"9414874395","email_address":"mhuffstickler@ncf.edu","office_location":"BON 007","mail_location":"SSC 102","user_image":null,"bio_content":null,"link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/listing\/madeline-huffstickler\/","employee_type":["staff"],"department":[{"name":"Social Sciences","slug":"social-sciences","link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/unit\/social-sciences\/"}],"exclude":null},{"slug":"courtney-hughes","first_name":"Courtney","last_name":"Hughes","pref_name":null,"position":"Assistant Director of National Fellowships","phone_number":"9414874112","email_address":"chughes@ncf.edu","office_location":"LBR 154","mail_location":"LBR 154","user_image":"https:\/\/newcollege.smugmug.com\/photos\/i-dMvGXhg\/0\/X2\/i-dMvGXhg-X2.jpg","bio_content":"","link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/listing\/courtney-hughes\/","employee_type":["staff"],"department":[{"name":"Center for Engagement &amp; Opportunity","slug":"center-for-engagement-and-opportunity","link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/unit\/center-for-engagement-and-opportunity\/"}],"exclude":null},{"slug":"suzanne-janney","first_name":"Suzanne","last_name":"Janney","pref_name":null,"position":"Special Assistant to the President","phone_number":"9414874110","email_address":"janney@ncf.edu","office_location":"COH 125","mail_location":"COH 204","user_image":"https:\/\/newcollege.smugmug.com\/photos\/i-FGTMtBN\/0\/X2\/i-FGTMtBN-X2.jpg","bio_content":"","link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/listing\/suzanne-janney\/","employee_type":["staff"],"department":[{"name":"President's Office","slug":"presidents-office","link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/unit\/presidents-office\/"}],"exclude":null},{"slug":"herman-johnson","first_name":"Herman","last_name":"Johnson","pref_name":null,"position":"Maintenance Support Worker","phone_number":"9414874218","email_address":"hjohnson@ncf.edu","office_location":"CAP 115","mail_location":"CAP 115","user_image":"https:\/\/newcollege.smugmug.com\/photos\/i-P8wxZbj\/0\/X2\/i-P8wxZbj-X2.jpg","bio_content":"","link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/listing\/herman-johnson\/","employee_type":["staff"],"department":[{"name":"Fitness Center","slug":"fitness-center","link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/unit\/fitness-center\/"}],"exclude":null},{"slug":"lee-johnson","first_name":"Lee","last_name":"Johnson","pref_name":null,"position":"Custodial Worker","phone_number":"9414874240","email_address":"ljohnson@ncf.edu","office_location":"PHS","mail_location":"PHS 104","user_image":"https:\/\/newcollege.smugmug.com\/photos\/i-NQDzmqj\/0\/X2\/i-NQDzmqj-X2.jpg","bio_content":"","link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/listing\/lee-johnson\/","employee_type":["staff"],"department":[{"name":"Physical Plant","slug":"physical-plant","link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/unit\/physical-plant\/"}],"exclude":null},{"slug":"colin-jordan","first_name":"Colin","last_name":"Jordan","pref_name":null,"position":"Director of Fitness Center","phone_number":"9414874218","email_address":"cjordan@ncf.edu","office_location":"HCL 001","mail_location":"HCL 001","user_image":"https:\/\/newcollege.smugmug.com\/photos\/i-bxQ8FRd\/0\/X2\/i-bxQ8FRd-X2.jpg","bio_content":"","link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/listing\/colin-jordan\/","employee_type":["staff"],"department":[{"name":"Fitness Center","slug":"fitness-center","link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/unit\/fitness-center\/"}],"exclude":null},{"slug":"amelia-kallaher","first_name":"Amelia","last_name":"Kallaher","pref_name":null,"position":"Assistant Librarian, Scholarly Resources","phone_number":"9414874313","email_address":"akallaher@ncf.edu","office_location":"LBR 214\/215","mail_location":"LBR 201","user_image":"https:\/\/newcollege.smugmug.com\/People\/Librarians\/n-n3GhV\/i-mtF2rQF\/0\/M\/i-mtF2rQF-M.jpg","bio_content":"<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Amelia Kallaher is the Scholarly Resources Librarian.

His biography presents a complex and fascinating figure (pious, but also willing to resort to violence if necessary in order to protect Buddhism) who travelled tirelessly across the continent (Nepal, India, Gilgit) in search of Buddhist teachings.<\/div>\n<p>I am also working on a secondary research project under the title From Suffering to Happiness: Buddhism and its transformations in the West that explores the evolution on the perception and interpretation of Buddhism in the West (from suffering to happiness) beginning with German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer\u2019s pessimistic presentation of the tradition in his 1818 work The World as Will and Representation, to the radically different presentation of the tradition in the last two decades in works such as Dalai Lama\u2019s 1998 book The Art of Happiness and Thich Nhat Hanh\u2019s 2009 Happiness: Essential Mindfulness Practices. Has Buddhism changed? Or is the West reinterpreting the Buddhist tradition to suit a different existential outlook on human nature? What is the role of some Buddhist figures in this transformation? Are figures like the Dalai Lama and Thich Nhat Hanh simply applying the old Buddhist practice of Skillful Means (Skt. up\u0101ya) in their explanation of Buddhism to a Western audience, or are they dramatically changing the nature of the Buddhist doctrine as its being introduced in the West? My project explores these questions while questioning our definitions a Buddhism in particular, and religion in general.<\/p>\n<p>I completed my undergraduate studies at the University Pompey Fabra (UPF) in Barcelona, Spain and my graduate work at the University of Virginia. I also have extensive experience studying in Asia. Between 1999 and 2001, I studied Tibetan and Chinese as well as Buddhism and Tibetan literature at Northwest Minorities University in Lanzhou (Gansu Province), and at Tibet University, in Lhasa (Tibetan Autonomous Region). In 2013 I studied and did field research for my dissertation at Minzu University of China. Between 2003 and 2009 I also worked as director and lecturer of the SIT Study Abroad Tibetan and Himalayan Studies Program, based in Kathmandu, Nepal, which allowed me to experience and study the rich diversity of the religious traditions across the Himalayas, as I lived, worked, and traveled in Northern India (Dharamsala), Nepal, Bhutan, and Tibet itself.<\/p>\n<p><strong>RECENT COURSES<\/strong><br \/>\nIntroduction to Buddhism<br \/>\nIntroduction to Hinduism<\/p>\n<p>Read more here:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/manuclasses.wordpress.com\">https:\/\/manuclasses.wordpress.com<\/a><\/p>\n","link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/listing\/manuel-lopez-zafra\/","employee_type":["faculty"],"department":[{"name":"Humanities","slug":"humanities","link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/unit\/humanities\/"},{"name":"Religion","slug":"religion","link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/listing\/manuel-lopez-zafra\/"}],"exclude":null},{"slug":"corey-loucks","first_name":"Corey","last_name":"Loucks","pref_name":"","position":"Police Communications Operator","phone_number":"9414874210","email_address":"cloucks@ncf.edu","office_location":"CPD","mail_location":"CPD 100","user_image":null,"bio_content":null,"link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/listing\/corey-loucks\/","employee_type":[],"department":[{"name":"Police","slug":"police","link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/unit\/police\/"}],"exclude":null},{"slug":"cliff-lundin","first_name":"Cliff","last_name":"Lundin","pref_name":"","position":"Admissions Coordinator","phone_number":"9414874264","email_address":"clundin@ncf.edu","office_location":"ROB 204","mail_location":"COH 114","user_image":"https:\/\/photos.smugmug.com\/People\/Staff\/n-QxzsLm\/i-Hfw6Zh4\/0\/S\/i-Hfw6Zh4-S.jpg","bio_content":"<p><strong>Education<\/strong><br \/>\nB.A. Psychology<br \/>\nNew College of Florida<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bio<\/strong><br \/>\nGreetings! I\u2019m Cliff, an Admissions Coordinator and recent graduate of New College. I fell in love with NCF after visiting the campus in 2011 due to its small size and academically passionate students. After one semester at NCF, I knew that I had made a great decision to attend. New College helped me develop and become more confident in my abilities, and I am excited that I get to share my stories and experiences with interested students.<\/p>\n<p>I started working in the Office of Admissions &amp; Financial Aid during my second-year at school as a Telecounselor. I served as a Telecounselor up until graduation, and only took some time off during the summers to serve as Assistant Manager at a local business in my hometown. I also took a semester off during my third-year to study abroad at Trinity College of Oxford University in Oxford, England. Apart from being a Telecounselor, during my final year of schooling, I served as a Student Admissions Representative for special events and co-led the student-run Psychology Club.<\/p>\n<p>My interests outside of New College include jogging, photography, and traveling. I also really enjoy reading psychological research studies. If you have any questions about student life, studying abroad, or literally about anything New College related, feel free to contact me.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Hometown<\/strong><br \/>\nHopatcong, New Jersey<\/p>\n","Territory_States":["CO","IL","IA","KS","MN","MO","NE","NM","OK"],"territory_fl_counties":["Broward","Charlotte","De Soto","Glades","Hardee","Hendry","Highlands","Sarasota"],"link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/listing\/cliff-lundin\/","employee_type":["admissions-counselor","staff"],"department":[{"name":"Admissions","slug":"admissions","link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/unit\/admissions\/"}],"exclude":null},{"slug":"curt-lutz","first_name":"Curt","last_name":"Lutz","pref_name":null,"position":"Groundskeeper","phone_number":"9414874240","email_address":"clutz@ncf.edu","office_location":"PHS","mail_location":"PHS 104","user_image":"https:\/\/newcollege.smugmug.com\/photos\/i-NQDzmqj\/0\/X2\/i-NQDzmqj-X2.jpg","bio_content":"","link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/listing\/curt-lutz\/","employee_type":["staff"],"department":[{"name":"Physical Plant","slug":"physical-plant","link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/unit\/physical-plant\/"}],"exclude":null},{"slug":"clara-luu","first_name":"Clara","last_name":"Luu","pref_name":"","position":"Staff Assistant","phone_number":"9414874105","email_address":"cluu@ncf.edu","office_location":"COH 210","mail_location":"COH 204","user_image":null,"bio_content":null,"link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/listing\/clara-luu\/","employee_type":["staff"],"department":[{"name":"President's Office","slug":"presidents-office","link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/unit\/presidents-office\/"}],"exclude":null},{"slug":"jeffrey-lynn","first_name":"Jeffrey","last_name":"Lynn","pref_name":null,"position":"Postal Delivery Clerk","phone_number":"9414874247","email_address":"jlynn@ncf.edu","office_location":"PMA 118","mail_location":"AMA 118","user_image":"https:\/\/newcollege.smugmug.com\/photos\/i-bxQ8FRd\/0\/X2\/i-bxQ8FRd-X2.jpg","bio_content":"","link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/listing\/jeffrey-lynn\/","employee_type":["staff"],"department":[{"name":"Mail and Postal Services","slug":"mail-and-postal-services","link":"https:\/\/www.ncf.edu\/directory\/unit\/mail-and-postal-services\/"}],"exclude":null},{"slug":"alexandra-maass","first_name":"Alexandra","last_name":"Maass","pref_name":null,"position":"Assistant Director of Writing","phone_number":"9414874506","email_address":"amaass@ncf.edu","office_location":"LBR 242","mail_location":"LBR 201","user_image":"https:\/\/newcollege.smugmug.com\/photos\/i-dMvGXhg\/0\/X2\/i-dMvGXhg-X2.jpg","bio_content":"<p><big>Assistant\u00a0Director of Writing<\/big><br \/>\nB.A, M.A., Southern Illinois University Carbondale<\/p>\n<p>In addition to co-leading the New College of Florida Writing Resource Center, Alexandra Maass teaches tutorials and courses in academic and analytical writing and peer writing instruction.

Dr. Saarinen uses a combination of field and laboratory based methods to evaluate the current status of small populations and couples this with museum-based research to evaluate historical population trends. In her molecular lab, she uses techniques to evaluate small tissue samples of butterflies to determine remaining levels of genetic diversity, gene flow, and inbreeding. Genomic scans from next-generation sequencing has recently been useful at identifying novel molecular markers for her work. She has received multiple grants from the United States Fish &amp; Wildlife Service and other state and federal agencies to support this research. She works with her students to evaluate and summarize all relevant data and communicate findings to assist with species management plans.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Saarinen teaches Ecology and Introduction to Environmental Science (fall 2014).

This is a field as old as Western culture itself, but I spend most of my time on American poetry written during the period from the end of the nineteenth-century to the present day. As I read, study, and teach poetry, I am constantly interested in the unexpectedly vexing question of what, exactly, it is \u2013 I mean, if you were to stumble upon a sheet of paper with some words on it, how would you tell whether or not it is a poem? One test: if you can identify with the workings of the words in a way very similar to how you might identify with the development of a song, then it\u2019s pretty likely that those marks on the page are the words of a poem. In fact, I often tell my students that reading a poem is more like listening to music than it is like reading a novel. Just what I mean by that is a touchstone of nearly everything I teach and write.<\/p>\n<p>My current research explores the relationship between innovative literary practice and music in post-World War II American poetry. Most of this work finds its way into my book project,\u00a0<em>Orphic Bend: Music and Innovative Writing<\/em>, which treats a wide range of writers, including Charles Bernstein, Jayne Cortez, Robert Creeley, Nathaniel Mackey, and John Taggart. Exploring the relationship between poetry and music in avant-garde opera, jazz aesthetics, performance poetry, postmodern pastoralism, and the elegy, the book identifies an exciting strain in contemporary innovative writing that participates in ancient debates over what music is, where it comes from, and what it does.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Thesis Sponsorship<\/strong><br \/>\nMy thesis students generally focus on American poetry since 1900. I have overseen projects on topics including contemporary prose poetry, the political and philosophical underpinnings of experimental writing, poetry as performance, jazz poetry, the politics of race in experimental black poetry and music, and others; and, I have worked closely with faculty in other fields to co-sponsor projects exploring poetry and disability studies, musical aesthetics in the work of James Joyce, contemporary Cuban-American poetry, and others. Outside of English, I have also sponsored thesis projects in the Humanities on radio documentary, the publishing history of the zine, and digital poetics.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Recent Courses<\/strong><br \/>\nAcoustic Machine: Modern Poetry and Music<br \/>\nThe Black Mountain School \/ The New York School<br \/>\nLines of Sight: the Ekphrastic Tradition from Homer to Today<br \/>\nThe Poetry and Poetics of Place<br \/>\nReading Poetry<\/p>\n<p><strong>Selected Publications<\/strong><br \/>\n\u201cEzra Pound and Charles Bernstein: Opera, Poetics, and the Fate of Humanism.\u201d Forthcoming in\u00a0<em>Texas Studies in Language and Literature.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe \u2018Umbilicate Ear\u2019: Audition in Ed Roberson\u2019s<em>\u00a0Lucid Interval as Integral Music<\/em>.\u201d Callaloo.

She has offered both survey and topical courses on Chinese literature and culture, covering periods, genres, writers, and literary movements of the pre-modern China extensively. Professor Zhang\u2019s scholarly work focuses on the rise of vernacular fiction, theater, and book culture in the late Ming and Qing China. Her recent research examines book illustrations, a prominent feature of books printed in this period, as both a form of commentary and a visual attraction.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Recent\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Courses<br \/>\n<\/strong>First-Year Modern Chinese<br \/>\nIntroduction to Classical Chinese<br \/>\nClassical Chinese Literature: A Survey<br \/>\nHeroism and Chinese Narratives<br \/>\nThe Cult of Qing: Culture and Literature in the Late Ming and Qing China<br \/>\nCinema and Cultural Memory: \u201cNew Cinema\u201d in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and China<\/p>\n<p><strong>Selected\u00a0<\/strong><strong>Publications<br \/>\n<\/strong>\u201cIn His Thievish Eyes: The Voyeur\/Reader in Li Yu\u2019s \u2018The Summer Pavilion\u2019,\u201d\u00a0<em>Southeast Review of Asian Studies<\/em>\u00a034 (2012): 25\u201342.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c\u91cd\u5beb\u8207\u6232\u64ec\uff1a\u8ad6\u300a\u8aaa\u5510\u5168\u50b3\u300b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7d\u9ed8\uff0c\u82f1\u96c4\u4e3b\u7fa9\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5145\u6eff\u60f3\u8c61\u7684\u95b1\u8b80,\u201da co-translation of Robert E.

I now have the privilege of working for an institution that I still consider home.<\/p>\n<p>In my spare time I adore traveling. While in college, I studied abroad in Viterbo, Italy. In Italy, I took every opportunity to explore places outside of my immediate location. With that same thirst for travel, I continue to contemplate where to go next. When I&#8217;m not at work I enjoy cycling and tennis, as well as soaking up the sunset on the Sarasota Bay with a novel in hand. In all my travels nothing beats Sarasota&#8217;s sunsets.<\/p>\n<p>I&#8217;m excited to talk to you about your interest in New College.
